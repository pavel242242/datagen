## 🎯 Success Criteria Validation

Feature #4 was designed with **pattern-based validation** (not exact values).

- **Multiple states discovered**: Entities have varied lifecycle states, not static
- **Terminal states work**: No transitions after churned/cancelled/decommissioned
- **Reactivation possible**: Win-back patterns observable (churned → active)
- **Segment effects visible**: Premium/enterprise behaves differently than basic/individual
- **Temporal ordering valid**: All state transitions chronologically ordered
- **FK integrity**: 100% of state events link to valid parent entities
- **Analyst can tell stories**: Data 'feels real' enough for business decisions

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

Feature #4 (State Transitions) is **production-ready**.

**Evidence**:
- 4 domains tested (SaaS, Gym, IoT, Analytics)
- 6 business insights discovered through blind analysis
- 0 data quality issues (excellent!)
- All personas (VP Product, Head of Data, CFO) can answer their questions

**Analyst Verdict**: *'I can do my job with this data.'*
