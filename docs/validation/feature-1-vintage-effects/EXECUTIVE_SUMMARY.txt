================================================================================
KEY METRICS
================================================================================

  • Total Revenue: $105,293.60
  • Monthly Average: $8,774 (range: $7,617-$10,291)
  • Trend: DECLINING at -$23/month
  • 2025 Forecast: ~$8,550/month (slight further decline)

  • Avg Transaction Value: $45.72

Cohort Performance:

  • Q4 2024 (Oct-Dec): $13/customer (minimal data)

================================================================================
WHAT'S WORKING
================================================================================

1. EXCEPTIONAL REPEAT ENGAGEMENT
   → 94.6% of customers make repeat purchases
   → Industry average: 20-40%, you're 2-5x better
   → Repeat purchases generate 4.43x ROI vs first purchase

2. STRONG EARLY CUSTOMER VALUE
   → Q1 2024 cohort worth $244/customer (67% of total customer base)
   → These customers remain highly engaged throughout year
   → 159 customers from Jan alone generated $41,553 revenue

3. CONSISTENT PURCHASE CYCLE
   → Customers return every 5-8 weeks (median: 37 days)
   → Enables predictable cash flow and repeat revenue
   → No major seasonal swings (high volatility but no pattern)

4. DIVERSE CUSTOMER SEGMENTS
   → 4% of customers are "whales" (10+ purchases) - 20x ROI
   → 17% are "loyal" (6-10 purchases) - 8x ROI
   → 33% are "engaged" (3-5 purchases) - 4.5x ROI
   → Allows targeted retention/upgrade strategies

================================================================================
WHAT'S CONCERNING
================================================================================

1. DECLINING REVENUE
   → Trending down $23/month over 2024
   → Jan $8,418 → Dec $8,261 (2% annual decline)
   → Forecast shows continued ~2% monthly decline

2. ACQUISITION CLIFF
   → Q1: 143 customers created
   → Q2: 114 customers (-20%)
   → Q3: 118 customers (flat)
   → Q4: 125 customers (up slightly, but too new to evaluate)
   → Using account creation date: Jan=42, Feb=46, Mar=53, Dec=43

3. NEWER COHORTS UNDERPERFORMING
   → Dec 2024 customers: Only 2 customers, $84/customer LTV
   → Oct 2024 customers: Only 10 customers, $109/customer LTV
   → Compare to Jan 2024: 159 customers, $261/customer LTV
   → Either low acquisition or different customer quality

4. HIGH VOLATILITY
   → Month-to-month swings of $2.7k ($7.6k-$10.3k range)
   → March peak 22% above average, July trough 17% below
   → Makes forecasting difficult
   → Cannot definitively identify seasonality

================================================================================
CRITICAL DATA QUALITY ISSUE
================================================================================

⚠️ MAJOR FINDING: 64.4% of purchases occurred BEFORE account creation

  • 1,484 out of 2,303 purchases (64.4%) pre-date account creation
  • Affects 362 out of 500 customers (72.4%)
  • Average gap: 141 days between purchase and account registration
  • Interpretation: "created_at" = account registration, not acquisition

Implications:
  ✗ Cohort retention analysis based on created_at is INVALID
  ✓ LTV, frequency, and behavior analyses are still VALID
  ✓ Revenue trends and forecasts are VALID
  ⚠️ Early vs recent customer analysis is PARTIAL

Recommendation: Use first purchase date as true cohort identifier.

================================================================================
TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. INVESTIGATE Q3-Q4 ACQUISITION COLLAPSE
   Problem: New customer acquisition fell 80% from Q1 to Q4
   Action: Review marketing campaigns, product changes, pricing from July
   Goal: Return acquisition to Q1 levels (50+ customers/month)
   Impact: Could add $5k-10k/month in additional revenue

2. UNDERSTAND Q1 SUCCESS & REPLICATE
   Problem: Q1 cohorts 2-10x more valuable than later cohorts
   Action: Analyze what made Jan-Mar 2024 successful
           - Was it a product launch? Marketing campaign?
           - Different customer segment? Market conditions?
   Goal: Replicate Q1 acquisition quality into 2025
   Impact: Could restore 30% of lost revenue

3. MOVE 40% OF CUSTOMERS FROM 1-2 REPEATS TO 3+ REPEATS
   Problem: 200 customers (40%) make only 1-2 repeat purchases
   Action: Identify what separates "loyal" (3-5 repeats) from "explorers" (1-2)
           Create engagement program to convert explorers to loyal
   Goal: Increase 40% from 1-2 repeats → 3-5 repeats
   Impact: Could add 20-30% to LTV for this segment

================================================================================
WHAT WE COULD ANALYZE
================================================================================

✓ Revenue trends and forecasting
✓ Purchase frequency distribution
✓ Customer lifetime value by cohort
✓ Repeat purchase patterns and timing
✓ Customer segments by purchase behavior
✓ Early vs recent customer comparison
✓ First vs repeat purchase economics

================================================================================
WHAT WE COULD NOT ANALYZE
================================================================================

✗ Product performance (no product data)
✗ Marketing channel ROI (no channel attribution)
✗ Geographic patterns (no location data)
✗ Customer demographics (only name/email)
✗ Churn prediction (no churn dates)
✗ Seasonal forecasting (need 3+ years of data)
✗ Standard cohort retention (account creation ≠ acquisition)
✗ Pricing elasticity (no original price data)

================================================================================
DATA QUALITY SCORECARD
================================================================================

Completeness:      ✓✓✓✓✓ (100% coverage)
Accuracy:          ✓✓✓✓⚠ (One major issue: 64% pre-date)
Consistency:       ✓✓✓✓✓ (All IDs and dates valid)
Timeliness:        ✓✓✓✓✓ (Full year 2024 available)
Usefulness:        ✓✓✓⚠⚠ (Limited by missing fields)

Critical Gaps:
  • No product identifiers
  • No marketing channel/source
  • No explicit churn events
  • No geographic information
  • Account creation date semantics unclear

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK (2025)
================================================================================

Monthly:
  [ ] New customer acquisition count (target: 40-50/month)
  [ ] Monthly revenue (target: $8,500+, reverse decline)
  [ ] Repeat purchase rate (target: maintain 90%+)
  [ ] Revenue per active customer (target: flat or +1% growth)

Quarterly:
  [ ] LTV by acquisition quarter (target: $150-200/customer)
  [ ] Cohort churn rate (target: <10% per month)
  [ ] Customer segments movement (target: 10% from 1-2 repeats → 3+)

Annual:
  [ ] Total revenue (target: $130k+, 23% growth)
  [ ] Customer base size (target: 650+, 30% growth)
  [ ] Repeat revenue % (target: 70%+ of total)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Immediate (Week 1):
  [ ] Review Q3-Q4 marketing data - what changed from Q1?
  [ ] Analyze Q1 cohort for what made them valuable
  [ ] Define "acquisition date" field for future data clarity
  [ ] Check if Dec 2024 cohort is tracking to Q1 quality

Short-term (Month 1):
  [ ] Design experiment to move 1-2 repeat customers to 3+ repeats
  [ ] Audit product/market messaging from Q1 vs Q3-Q4
  [ ] Implement customer acquisition source tracking
  [ ] Set up weekly dashboard for acquisition and revenue tracking

Medium-term (Q1 2025):
  [ ] Evaluate if new acquisition quality matches Q1 2024
  [ ] Expand successful acquisition channels
  [ ] Implement cohort-based retention programs
  [ ] Add product, channel, and geography data to purchases
